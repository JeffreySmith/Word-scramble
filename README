This is my word scrambling game for intro to c++

To build this you will need to install Qt: http://qt.nokia.com/products/

This should run on mac, *nixes, and windows, but I haven't tested it on anything but my mac.

run "qmake -project" in this directory, then make (If your platform requires something else, do that instead!)
